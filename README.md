# NexusOS - Enterprise Incident Response Platform

NexusOS is an enterprise-grade incident response platform designed for autonomous incident triage, multi-agent coordination, compliance monitoring, and distributed Model Context Protocol (MCP) integrations.

> **Note**: This repository represents **Phase 1: Project Foundation**. It establishes the modular architecture, directory structure, TypeScript configurations, environment placeholders, PostgreSQL database connection wrapper, and minimal dashboard placeholder without active business logic, workflows, or MCP tools.

---

# Project Overview

Modern enterprises rely on multiple departments to respond to security incidents.

When ransomware, data breaches, insider threats, service outages, or unauthorized access occur, every department investigates independently using different systems, dashboards, workflows, and communication channels.
Security teams analyze threats.
Compliance teams verify regulatory obligations.
Operations teams decide mitigation strategies.
Communication teams notify stakeholders.
Because these departments rarely collaborate through a common intelligence platform, organizations experience:

- Slow incident response
- Conflicting recommendations
- Missed regulatory obligations
- Delayed stakeholder communication
- Increased operational losses
- Poor auditability
- Lack of explainable decision making

NexusOS solves this problem by introducing a collaborative enterprise intelligence platform powered by **distributed Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers**.
Instead of relying on a single AI model to make every decision, NexusOS enables specialized AI agents to collaborate through independent MCP servers while a deterministic Arbitration Engine produces the final enterprise-approved response.

---

# Purpose

NexusOS is designed to become an autonomous enterprise coordination platform capable of assisting organizations during critical incidents.
Its primary objective is to combine artificial intelligence with deterministic business rules to produce transparent, explainable, and enterprise-safe decisions.
The platform demonstrates how modern enterprises can safely integrate AI into incident response workflows without allowing a language model to become the ultimate decision maker.
Instead, AI generates structured recommendations while deterministic arbitration validates, prioritizes, and approves enterprise actions.

---

# Problem Statement

Traditional enterprise incident response suffers from fragmented decision-making.
Every department operates independently.
Each team uses different tools.
Each team maintains different knowledge.
Each team recommends different actions.

As organizations grow larger, these disconnected workflows create significant operational challenges:

- Longer Mean Time To Detect (MTTD)
- Longer Mean Time To Respond (MTTR)
- Increased financial losses
- Compliance violations
- Delayed customer communication
- Human decision bottlenecks
- Limited visibility across departments

Although modern AI assistants provide recommendations, they often lack:

- Department specialization
- Enterprise governance
- Deterministic reasoning
- Explainable workflows
- Safe tool orchestration
- Regulatory awareness
NexusOS addresses these limitations through collaborative multi-agent intelligence built upon the Model Context Protocol.

# Why NexusOS?

Unlike conventional AI assistants, NexusOS separates intelligence into specialized organizational domains.
Each enterprise function owns its own knowledge, tools, and decision logic.
Rather than asking one LLM to solve everything, NexusOS creates an ecosystem of collaborating enterprise experts.

The result is:

- Faster response times
- Explainable recommendations
- Modular architecture
- Secure enterprise integrations
- Deterministic approvals
- Reusable organizational knowledge
- Simplified scalability

# Architecture Goals

NexusOS is designed around six enterprise engineering goals.
## 1. Modularity
Every department owns an independent MCP server.
Adding a new department requires no changes to existing agents.

---

## 2. Explainability
Every recommendation contains:
- reasoning
- supporting evidence
- originating department
- generated actions
Nothing is hidden behind a black-box response.

---

## 3. Deterministic Decision Making
Language models generate recommendations.
Business rules approve decisions.
This ensures predictable enterprise behavior.

---

## 4. Enterprise Safety
No AI agent directly accesses enterprise systems.
Every action passes through controlled MCP tools.

---

## 5. Scalability

Departments can be added independently.
Future MCPs may include:
- Finance
- HR
- Legal
- Cloud Operations
- Infrastructure
- DevOps
- Procurement

without redesigning the architecture.

---

## 6. Auditability
Every incident records:
- tools invoked
- proposals generated
- final decisions
- timestamps
- execution history
creating a complete enterprise audit trail.

---

# System Architecture

NexusOS follows a distributed, modular, multi-agent architecture built around the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. Instead of allowing a single AI model to directly access enterprise systems, specialized AI agents communicate with dedicated MCP servers that encapsulate enterprise knowledge, business logic, and organizational policies.

The platform is divided into five architectural layers:

1. Event Collection Layer
2. AI Coordination Layer
3. MCP Intelligence Layer
4. Enterprise Knowledge Layer
5. Presentation & Audit Layer

This layered architecture ensures modularity, scalability, explainability, and enterprise-grade governance.

# Change Detection Workflow

NexusOS continuously monitors changes across enterprise infrastructure.

```mermaid

The Change Detection Engine continuously evaluates:

- Infrastructure modifications

- Threat intelligence changes
- Asset inventory updates
- Configuration drift
- Enterprise topology changes

# Architectural Principles

NexusOS follows several enterprise architecture principles:

| Principle | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Separation of Concerns | Agents orchestrate while MCP servers encapsulate business logic. |
| Loose Coupling | AI agents never directly access enterprise systems. |
| Explainability | Every recommendation is traceable to its originating MCP tool. |
| Deterministic Governance | Final decisions are governed by business rules instead of probabilistic LLM outputs. |
| Modular Expansion | New enterprise departments can be introduced without modifying existing agents. |
| Auditability | Every action is permanently logged for compliance and forensic investigation. |
| Reusability | MCP servers expose reusable enterprise capabilities across multiple workflows. |
| Scalability | Independent MCP modules can be deployed and scaled individually. |

# Enterprise Tool Workflow

1. **Security MCP** analyzes the incident, scans infrastructure, builds a timeline, and computes a risk score.
2. **Compliance MCP** evaluates GDPR and ISO/IEC 27001 obligations, generates compliance documentation, and prepares an executive incident summary.
3. **Mail MCP** prepares notifications for management, IT teams, and affected customers.
4. **Arbitration MCP** aggregates all proposals, resolves conflicts, prioritizes actions, and generates the final deterministic decision.
5. Once all approved actions are completed, the incident is officially closed and archived with a complete audit trail.
